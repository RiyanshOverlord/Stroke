    <h1>About Stroke Prediction</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Stroke Prediction system! This application collects a set of health and lifestyle inputs to estimate your risk for stroke. Our goal is to provide you with insights that can help in early detection and preventive care.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Inputs We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Age:</strong> Your age is a critical factor, as stroke risk increases with age.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>BMI (Body Mass Index):</strong> Calculated from your height and weight, BMI helps determine if you're underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. Higher BMI values can indicate increased risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hypertension:</strong> Whether you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Heart Disease:</strong> If you have any history of heart-related conditions, this will impact your overall risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Average Glucose Level:</strong> Your blood sugar levels, which are important because high glucose levels can damage blood vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we collect some lifestyle and demographic details (such as gender, marital status, work status, living environment, and smoking status) which are used to refine the prediction.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What It Means</h2>
    <p>
      The system uses a machine learning model (logistic regression) that was trained on a dataset of patient health data. The model combines your inputs to predict the risk of having a stroke. Your prediction score is displayed as a gauge meter on your report page.
    </p>
    <p>
      A higher score indicates a higher estimated risk. This information is intended to raise awareness and encourage you to consult healthcare professionals if you have concerns about your health.
